## 🔧 **Technical Improvements Implemented**

### **Routing Enhancement**

- **Before**: State-based navigation (not bookmarkable)
- **After**: Hash-based URLs (`#/courses/123`) with full browser support

### **Course Management Flow**

- **Before**: Complex course cards with inline delete buttons
- **After**: Clean course list → detailed course pages → edit/delete operations

### **User Experience**

- **Before**: All operations on single page
- **After**: Logical flow with clear navigation and confirmations

### **Code Organization**

- **Before**: Single routing approach in App.jsx
- **After**: Reusable custom hooks + separated concerns

## 🧪 **Tested & Verified Features**

### **Hash Routing Tests**

- ✅ **Direct URL Access**: `localhost:5173/#/courses/123` works
- ✅ **Browser Navigation**: Back/forward buttons functional
- ✅ **Bookmarking**: URLs can be saved and shared
- ✅ **Navigation Flow**: All internal links work correctly

### **Course Management Tests**

- ✅ **Course Creation**: Add course form → success → redirect to courses
- ✅ **Course Viewing**: Simplified list shows code/name as clickable links
- ✅ **Course Details**: Individual course pages display all information
- ✅ **Course Editing**: Inline edit form → save → view updated details
- ✅ **Course Deletion**: Confirmation → delete → redirect to course list
